# Statistical Modeling in R

In this workshop, you will learn how to navigate through key stages of statistical modeling using common R packages. You will be introduced to various handy packages and tools used in R starting from data cleaning, to modeling and visualization. The workshop focuses on implementation rather than statistical concepts and theory.

Prerequisites: Familiarity with basic statistics (hypotheses tests and confidence intervals, linear regression), R at the level of the R Fundamentals Bootcamp workshop, and the Tidyverse packages at the level of the R Tidyverse Basics workshop.

Details: This workshop will happen live, in-person and will not be recorded. You will need to bring a laptop to participate. Instructions will be sent out after you register on how to install R and key packages to your laptop.
